0,2021-09-02,NVDA,@kenconundrum Yes! One of my favorite patterns are DOUBLE INSIDE DAY candles.   Which is what $NVDA is doing today

4,2021-09-02,NFLX,@clayspurlock4 $NFLX ... very impressive strength this week especially... but it's at a spot where it stalled in the past. Might need a small pullback before ramping up to $700 tgt  https://t.co/QfJtTp2LjF
5,2021-09-02,BTU,"$BTU ... at this point, given the relentless nature of this uptrend, looks like $20 is the next target  https://t.co/2f9TUIaiuJ"
6,2021-09-01,ASAN,$ASAN ... one of my favorite setups out there right now... Only caveat is that it reports earnings after the close today!  A must watch to see if it creates another PEG!   No position in it now but watching very closely!  https://t.co/RBvFzrqrYa

9,2021-09-01,CLF,"A beautiful quick dip to test the 20 day MA... and printing a very nice reversal today in this $CLF   Starting to really firm up nicely in this bullish flag pattern. Look for a big breakout any day now, imho  Targets: $28 to $30  https://t.co/WaZFFUOygX"

15,2021-09-01,PDD,@Jatmoney $PDD is technically a PEG but since it's China based and there's been all sorts of unpredictable stuff going on there with government crack downs so this one isn't as appealing(for now at least)
16,2021-09-01,PRFT,@johnjoseph7177 $PRFT is a fantastic example!
17,2021-09-01,DOCS,$DOCS... chugging nicely higher into the close  https://t.co/yzcipEMoIE

27,2021-08-31,CRM,"@GodAwfulTrader I do see what you're seeing in $CRM   However, only reason why it's not a true PEG... is because the stock gapped up on earnings but closed BELOW where it opened! This is not what i like to see"
28,2021-08-31,TSM,"@kas_trades $TSM reported earnings on July 15th and the stock gapped down! So no, this is not a good example of a bullish PEG candle.   Take a look at $PANW and $TEAM as much better recent PEG examples!   Hope this helps!  https://t.co/OKNI3EHPzi"

31,2021-08-31,CLF,@LiesTbe I do think so! Still holding $CLF
32,2021-08-31,TASK,For Educational Purposes  Study this $TASK chart closely. Note how it made a nice PEG(Power Earnings Gap) in early August that was followed by a beautiful post-PEG consolidation(Bull Flag)   https://t.co/eUwCouwq90  A strong pattern especially when coupled with Accumulation Volume  https://t.co/3z34Ysc5fM
33,2021-08-31,PXLW,$PXLW ... a new addition to the PEG watchlist this month.   Showing good Accumulation Volume last few days and today it's printing an INSIDE DAY candle. Worth watching this one going into tomorrow and rest of the week.   Targets: $8  https://t.co/8M06LBSBmW

35,2021-08-31,NUE,$NUE ... pulling back a bit today with the rest of the Steel makers.   Testing the 20 day MA here... look for buyers to step back into this one tomorrow. A break over $123.50 could ignite this mini bull flag  https://t.co/ZtacF9eaAI
36,2021-08-31,UPST,$UPST ... showing very good relative strength and momentum since the recent PEG  https://t.co/zQyf35b9h1

56,2021-08-27,NCTY,@deltasierrapapa $NCTy is the ultimate choppy stock... but there's a clear base building here.   It will probably take off when no one is looking at it!
57,2021-08-27,NVDA,@piroumian I would keep holding $NVDA   Looks headed to at least $250  https://t.co/KuOyiTTjYp

60,2021-08-27,DVAX,Unless $DVAX pulls off what $SPRT did this week.... The stock($DVAX) is looking quite extended here and thinking a small pullback or a few days to consolidate into a bull flag is soon in order after a +50% move this week!  https://t.co/r5R5W5AkJP

88,2021-08-25,HUYA,@kingofthecopy Another speculative play in $HUYA...  looks to be mustering up a bounce after the big decline. Looks oversold enough for a multi-day bounce
89,2021-08-25,NCTY,$NCTY ... this one is obviously quite speculative ... but hard to ignore the recent Accumulation Volume patterns. Short interest is on the higher side.   Might be watching purely for a squeeze play next few days.  https://t.co/CFL865AEmR
90,2021-08-25,PINS,@CAS5582 $PINS chart got hit pretty good on the last earnings report. I'd give it some time to repair some of the damage.
91,2021-08-24,RSI,@peee90 $RSI falls in that category. Good pick up in accumulation volume patterns. Would be even better if short interest was much higher
